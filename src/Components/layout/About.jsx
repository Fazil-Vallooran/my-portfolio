      Iâ€™m a software tester passionate about ensuring quality and 
      reliability in every product I work on. With a keen eye for detail 
      and a commitment to continuous learning, I strive to bridge the gap between 
      development and user experience. My journey in tech has equipped me with a 
      strong foundation in both manual and automated testing, and I enjoy collaborating 
      with cross-functional teams to deliver exceptional results.
